The lightning network is growing and people don't know how to spend their lightning coins. Therefore I made this simple html website hosted in github pages that lists the stores that I know. 


The following websites forward to www.lightningnetworkstores.github.io:

www.lightningnetworkstores.com

www.lightningnetworkshops.com

Contributions are welcome, I will even give pull/merge permissions to who proves to be trustworthy or forward the registered domains to your forked website if its open source and well maintained.

I wrote the website in markdown syntax and converted it into html.
